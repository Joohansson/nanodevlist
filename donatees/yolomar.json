   "description":"Creator and maintainer of [Trynano](https://www.trynano.io), a site for introducing newcomers to Nano by allowing them to try out Nano hands-on instantly, for free, and with zero setup/hassle. Two wallets are generated for the user, a built-in faucet is available to use to get some Nano right away, the user can ping the nano back and forth between the two wallets and see the transaction results, and lastly, the user can create their own private wallet and send that nano to their newly created wallet right away (or simply return it back to where it came from). Your contribution will help to keep the site up and running for years to come!",
