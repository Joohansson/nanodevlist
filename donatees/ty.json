  "description": "I'm a Software Engineer from San Francisco, CA. I have a passion for building user intuitive products in the iOS and crypto spaces. A couple of my most notable projects are [BrainBlocks](https://github.com/brainblocks) and [Vybe](https://github.com/vybetoken). I dedicate most of my free time towards my projects that are free to others to use. Sponsors will support the various costs that are involved with my projects such as server costs and paid APIs",
