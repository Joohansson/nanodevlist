  "description": "I'm a freelance developer from Finland. I have a passion for programming, servers, networking and anything in between. Most of my projects are related to the Nano cryptocurrency. I've developed [nanocurrency-web](https://github.com/numsu/nanocurrency-web-js) in order to help developers embrace Nano and to provide a secure way to handle the users' keys. I'm also the sole developer of [Nalli](https://nalli.app). A cryptocurrency wallet which allows you to send Nano to your contacts by using their phone number, while doing all of the other crucial parts of a mobile wallet securely.",
